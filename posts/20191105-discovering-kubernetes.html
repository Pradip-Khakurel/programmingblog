            <h1>Discovering Kubernetes</h1>
            <p><i>Kubernetes</i> is a distributed cluster management application that makes easy to deploy, manage and scale applications in a public or private cloud. It moves away the complexity of an infrastructure by abstracting the cluster into a single <u>gigantic machine with plenty of ressources.</u></p>
            <blockquote><p>Scaling application can be diffcult from scratch. Kubernetes helps you do that more easily.</p></blockquote>
            <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
            <h3>Pods</h3>
            <p>A <i>pod</i> is collection of one or more container images, like <i>Docker</i> images, that work together. A pod is deployed as a single unit. The container technology makes an application easy to deploy anywhere regardless of the operating system. A pod typically runs on a worker node. Each pod of the cluster has an unique IP in order to exchange traffic. But a pod IP is only visible inside the cluster. In addition, a pod is short lived, making their IP possibly not useful to rely on. In order to access a pod consistently and externally, we need to use an object called a service. A pod can also contain other resources shared between its container application.</p>
            <h3>Services</h3>
            <p>A service is a way of grouping a set of nods that have common characteristics. The service has an IP that is visible from the outside. A service will automatically select its pods based on their label. The IP address is durable during the life of the Kubernetes cluster and can be used safely by the outside. A service will typically load balance traffic among its pods.</p>
            <h3>Master slave</h3>
            <p>Kubernetes has a master slave distributed architecture. The master node is the cockpit of the cluster and interact with a client through its API service. The worker nodes are responsible for running the pods through an agent called kubelet. The application needed to run container images is also installed in each node. In order to understand the concepts of kubernetes, letâ€™s use a small example. In this example, we create a python server application, and deploy it in a small kubernetes environment that runs on a single VM: minikube. Minikube is very useful because it allows to test kubernetes locally without the actual need of a real cluster. After its deployment, we will expose the app to the outside and scale it up.</p>
